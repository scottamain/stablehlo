## Preview the website locally

If you're working on some docs, it's easy to preview your work locally:

1. Start a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/mkdocs

source ~/.venvs/mkdocs/bin/activate
```

2. Install Material for MkDocs:

```bash
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
```

3. Navigate to the stablhlo root directory and start the local server:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

4. Open a browser to http://localhost:8000/.

That's it. The web pages automatically reload while you edit the markdown files.
