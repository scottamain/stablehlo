<h1 id="stablehlo-specification">StableHLO Specification<a class="headerlink" href="#stablehlo-specification" title="Permanent link">link</a></h1>
<p>StableHLO is an operation set for high-level operations (HLO) in machine
learning (ML) models. StableHLO works as a portability layer between different
ML frameworks and ML compilers: ML frameworks that produce StableHLO programs
are compatible with ML compilers that consume StableHLO programs.</p>
<p>Our goal is to simplify and accelerate ML development by creating more
interoperability between various ML frameworks (such as TensorFlow, JAX and
PyTorch) and ML compilers (such as XLA and IREE). Towards that end, this
document provides a specification for the StableHLO programming language.</p>
<p>This specification contains three major sections. First, the "Programs" section
describes the structure of StableHLO programs which consist of StableHLO
functions which themselves consist of StableHLO ops. Within that structure, the
"Ops" section specifies semantics of individual ops. Finally, the "Execution"
section provides semantics for all these ops executing together within
a program.</p>

<p><strong>StableHLO programs</strong> consist of an arbitrary number of StableHLO functions.
Below is an example program with a function <code>@main</code> which has 3 inputs
(<code>%image</code>, <code>%weights</code> and <code>%bias</code>) and 1 output. The body of the function
has 6 ops.</p>

<p><strong>StableHLO identifiers</strong> are similar to identifiers in many programming
languages, with two peculiarities: 1) all identifiers have sigils which
distinguish different kinds of identifiers, 2) value identifiers can be
completely numeric to simplify generation of StableHLO programs.</p>

<p><strong>StableHLO types</strong> are categorized into <strong>value types</strong> (which are also called
<strong>first-class types</strong>) which represent StableHLO values and <strong>non-value types</strong>
which describe other program elements. StableHLO types are similar to types in
many programming languages, with the main peculiarity being StableHLO's
domain-specific nature which results in some unusual outcomes (e.g. scalar types
are not value types).</p>

<p><strong>Tensor types</strong> represent tensors, i.e. multidimensional arrays. They have a
<strong>shape</strong> and an <strong>element type</strong>, where a shape represents non-negative
<strong>dimension sizes</strong> in the ascending order of the corresponding <strong>dimensions</strong>
(which are also called <strong>axes</strong>) numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>R-1</code>. The number of
dimensions <code>R</code> is called <strong>rank</strong>. For example, <code>tensor&lt;2x3xf32&gt;</code> is a tensor
type with shape <code>2x3</code> and element type <code>f32</code>. It has two dimensions (or,
in other words, two axes) - 0th dimension and 1st dimension - whose sizes are
2 and 3. Its rank is 2.</p>

</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Token types</strong> represent tokens, i.e. opaque values produced and consumed
by some operations. Tokens are used for imposing execution order on operations
as described in the "Execution" section.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">TupleType </span><span class="err">::</span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;tuple&#39;</span> <span class="s1">&#39;&lt;&#39;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="k">ValueType </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="s1">&#39;,&#39;</span> <span class="k">ValueType</span><span class="p">}]</span> <span class="s1">&#39;&gt;&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Tuple types</strong> represent tuples, i.e. heterogeneous lists. Tuples are a legacy
feature which only exists for compatibility with HLO. In HLO, tuples are
used to represent variadic inputs and outputs. In StableHLO, variadic inputs and
outputs are supported natively, and the only use of tuples in StableHLO is to
comprehensively represent HLO ABI where e.g. <code>T</code>, <code>tuple&lt;T&gt;</code> and
<code>tuple&lt;tuple&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> may be materially different depending on a particular
implementation.</p>

<p><strong>Element types</strong> represent elements of tensor types. Unlike in many programming
languages, these types are not first class in StableHLO. This means that
StableHLO programs cannot directly represent values of these types (as a result,
it is idiomatic to represent scalar values of type <code>T</code> with 0-dimensional tensor
values of type <code>tensor&lt;T&gt;</code>).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Boolean type</strong> represents boolean values <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Integer types</strong> can be either signed (<code>si</code>) or unsigned (<code>ui</code>) and have
    one of the supported bit widths (<code>4</code>, <code>8</code>, <code>16</code>, <code>32</code> or <code>64</code>).
    Signed <code>siN</code> types represent integer values from <code>-2^(N-1)</code> to <code>2^(N-1)-1</code>
    inclusive, and unsigned <code>uiN</code> types represent integer values from <code>0</code> to
    <code>2^N-1</code> inclusive.</li>
<li><strong>Floating-point types</strong> can be one of the following:<ul>
<li><code>f8E4M3FN</code> and <code>f8E5M2</code> types corresponding to respectively the
<code>E4M3</code> and <code>E5M2</code> encodings of the FP8 format described in
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05433">FP8 Formats for Deep Learning</a>.</li>
<li><code>bf16</code> type corresponding to the <code>bfloat16</code> format described in
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/bfloat16-the-secret-to-high-performance-on-cloud-tpus">BFloat16: The secret to high performance on Cloud TPUs</a>.</li>
<li><code>f16</code>, <code>f32</code> and <code>f64</code> types corresponding to respectively
<code>binary16</code> ("half precision"), <code>binary32</code> ("single precision") and
<code>binary64</code> ("double precision") formats described in
<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8766229">the IEEE 754 standard</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Complex types</strong> represent complex values that have a <strong>real part</strong>
    and an <strong>imaginary part</strong> of the same <strong>element type</strong>. Supported complex
    types are <code>complex&lt;f32&gt;</code> (both parts are of type <code>f32</code>) and <code>complex&lt;f64&gt;</code>
    (both parts are of type <code>f64</code>).</li>

<p><strong>StableHLO operations</strong> (which are also called <strong>ops</strong>) represent a closed set

StableHLO syntax is heavily inspired by MLIR, which is not necessarily the most

<p>Ops consume <strong>inputs</strong> and produce <strong>outputs</strong>. Inputs are categorized into
input values (computed during execution), input functions (provided
statically, because in StableHLO functions are not first-class values) and
input attributes (also provided statically). The kind of inputs and outputs
consumed and produced by an op depends on its mnemonic. For example, the <code>add</code>
op consumes 2 input values and produces 1 output value. In comparison, the
<code>select_and_scatter</code> op consumes 3 input values, 2 input functions and
3 input attributes.</p>

<p><strong>Input functions</strong> (which are also called <strong>anonymous functions</strong>) are very
similar to named functions except that: 1) they don't have an identifier (hence
the name "anonymous"), 2) they don't declare output types (output types are
inferred from the <code>return</code> op within the function).</p>
<p>The syntax for input functions includes a currently unused part (see the
<code>Unused</code> production above) which is there for compatibility with MLIR. In MLIR,
there is a more general concept of "regions" which can have multiple "blocks"
of ops connected together via jump ops. These blocks have ids which correspond
to the <code>Unused</code> production, so that they can be distinguished from each other.
StableHLO doesn't have jump ops, so the corresponding part of MLIR syntax is
unused (but is still there).</p>

<p><strong>Input attributes</strong> have a name and a value which is one of the supported
constants. They are the primary way to specify static metadata for program
elements. For example, the <code>concatenate</code> op uses the attribute <code>dimension</code> to
specify the dimension along which its input values are concatenated. Similarly,
the <code>slice</code> op uses multiple attributes like <code>start_indices</code> and <code>limit_indices</code>
to specify the bounds that are used to slice the input value.</p>

<p><strong>Op signature</strong> consists of the types of all input values (the list of types on
the left-hand side of <code>-&gt;</code>) and the types of all output values (the list of
types on the right-hand side of <code>-&gt;</code>). Strictly speaking, input types are
redundant, and output types are almost always redundant as well (because for
most StableHLO ops, output types can be inferred from inputs). Nonetheless, op
signature is deliberately part of StableHLO syntax for compatibility with MLIR.</p>
<p>Below is an example op whose mnemonic is <code>select_and_scatter</code>. It consumes 3
input values (<code>%operand</code>, <code>%source</code> and <code>%init_value</code>), 2 input functions
and 3 input attributes (<code>window_dimensions</code>, <code>window_strides</code> and <code>padding</code>).
Note how the signature of the op only includes the types of its input values
(but not the types of input functions and attributes which are provided inline).</p>

<p>The values of <code>comparison_direction</code> and <code>compare_type</code> have the following
semantics:</p>
<p>For boolean and integer element types:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>EQ</code>: <code>lhs</code> <span class="arithmatex">\(=\)</span> <code>rhs</code>.</li>
<li><code>NE</code>: <code>lhs</code> <span class="arithmatex">\(\ne\)</span> <code>rhs</code>.</li>
<li><code>GE</code>: <code>lhs</code> <span class="arithmatex">\(\ge\)</span> <code>rhs</code>.</li>
<li><code>GT</code>: <code>lhs</code> <span class="arithmatex">\(\gt\)</span> <code>rhs</code>.</li>
<li><code>LE</code>: <code>lhs</code> <span class="arithmatex">\(\le\)</span> <code>rhs</code>.</li>
<li><code>LT</code>: <code>lhs</code> <span class="arithmatex">\(\lt\)</span> <code>rhs</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For floating-point element types and <code>compare_type = FLOAT</code>, the op implements
the following IEEE-754 operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>EQ</code>: <code>compareQuietEqual</code>.</li>
<li><code>NE</code>: <code>compareQuietNotEqual</code>.</li>
<li><code>GE</code>: <code>compareQuietGreaterEqual</code>.</li>
<li><code>GT</code>: <code>compareQuietGreater</code>.</li>
<li><code>LE</code>: <code>compareQuietLessEqual</code>.</li>
<li><code>LT</code>: <code>compareQuietLess</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For floating-point element types and <code>compare_type = TOTALORDER</code>, the op
uses the combination of <code>totalOrder</code> and <code>compareQuietEqual</code> operations from
IEEE-754.</p>
<p>For complex element types, lexicographic comparison of <code>(real, imag)</code> pairs is
performed using the provided <code>comparison_direction</code> and <code>compare_type</code>.</p>

<p>Performs an element-wise conversion from one element type to another on
<code>operand</code> tensor and produces a <code>result</code> tensor.</p>
<p>For conversions involving <strong>integer-to-integer</strong>, if there is an unsigned/signed
overflow, the result is implementation-defined and one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>mathematical result modulo <span class="arithmatex">\(2^n\)</span>, where n is the bit width of the result,
    for unsigned overflow. For signed integer overflow, wraps the result around
    the representable range <span class="arithmatex">\([-2^{n-1},\ 2^{n-1} - 1]\)</span>.</li>
<li>saturation to <span class="arithmatex">\(2^{n-1} - 1\)</span> (or <span class="arithmatex">\(-2^{n-1}\)</span>) for signed overflow and
    saturation to <span class="arithmatex">\(2^n - 1\)</span> (or <span class="arithmatex">\(0\)</span>) for unsigned overflow.</li>
</ul>
<p>For conversions involving <strong>floating-point-to-floating-point</strong> or
<strong>integer-to-floating-point</strong>, if the source value can be exactly represented in
the destination type, the result value is that exact representation. Otherwise,
the behavior is TBD.</p>
<p>Conversion involving <strong>complex-to-complex</strong> follows the same behavior of
<strong>floating-point-to-floating-point</strong> conversions for converting real and
imaginary parts.</p>
<p>For conversions involving <strong>floating-point-to-complex</strong> or
<strong>complex-to-floating-point</strong>, the destination imaginary value is zeroed or the
source imaginary value is ignored, respectively. The conversion of the real part
follows the <strong>floating-point-to-floating-point</strong> conversion.</p>
<p>Conversions involving <strong>integer-to-complex</strong> follows the same behavior as
<strong>integer-to-floating-point</strong> conversion while converting the source integer to
destination real part. The destination imaginary part is zeroed.</p>
<p>For conversions involving <strong>floating-point-to-integer</strong>, the fractional part is
truncated. If the truncated value cannot be represented in the destination type,
the behavior is TBD. Conversions involving <strong>complex-to-integer</strong> follows the
same behavior while converting the source real part to destination integer. The
source imaginary part is ignored.</p>
<p>For <strong>boolean-to-any-supported-type</strong> conversions, the value <code>false</code> is
converted to zero, and the value <code>true</code> is converted to one. For
<strong>any-supported-type-to-boolean</strong> conversions, a zero value is converted to
<code>false</code> and any non-zero value is converted to <code>true</code>.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../images/spec/convolution.svg" /></p>
<p>More formally, consider the following reframing of the inputs in terms of <code>lhs</code>
in order to be able to express windows of <code>lhs</code>:</p>
<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->
<ul>
<li><code>lhs_window_dimensions = lhs_shape(dim(lhs, input_batch_dimension), dim(rhs, kernel_spatial_dimensions), dim(lhs, input_feature_dimension))</code>.</li>

<li><code>lhs_window_start = lhs_shape(0, output_spatial_index, 0) * lhs_window_strides</code>.</li>
<li><code>lhs_window = slice(padded_lhs, lhs_window_start, lhs_window_start + lhs_window_dimensions, lhs_window_dilations)</code>.</li>

<h3 id="semantics_34">Semantics<a class="headerlink" href="#semantics_34" title="Permanent link">link</a></h3>
<p>Performs the forward and inverse Fourier transforms for real and complex
inputs/outputs.</p>
<p><code>fft_type</code> is one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>FFT</code>: Forward complex-to-complex FFT.</li>
<li><code>IFFT</code>: Inverse complex-to-complex FFT.</li>
<li><code>RFFT</code>: Forward real-to-complex FFT.</li>
<li><code>IRFFT</code>: Inverse real-to-complex FFT (i.e. takes complex, returns real).</li>
</ul>
<p>More formally, given the function <code>fft</code> which takes 1-dimensional tensors of
complex types as input, produces 1-dimensional tensors of same types as
output and computes the discrete Fourier transform:</p>
<p>For <code>fft_type = FFT</code>, <code>result</code> is defined as the final result of a series of L
computations where <code>L = size(fft_length)</code>. For example, for <code>L = 3</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>result1[i0, ..., :]</code> = <code>fft(operand[i0, ..., :])</code> for all <code>i</code>.</li>
<li><code>result2[i0, ..., :, iR-1]</code> = <code>fft(result1[i0, ..., :, iR-1])</code> for all <code>i</code>.</li>
<li><code>result[i0, ..., :, iR-2, iR-1]</code> = <code>fft(result2[i0, ..., :, iR-2, iR-1])</code>
    for all <code>i</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, given the function <code>ifft</code> which has the same type signature and
computes the inverse of <code>fft</code>:</p>
<p>For <code>fft_type = IFFT</code>, <code>result</code> is defined as the inverse of the computations
for <code>fft_type = FFT</code>. For example, for <code>L = 3</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>result1[i0, ..., :, iR-2, iR-1]</code> = <code>ifft(operand[i0, ..., :, iR-2, iR-1])</code>
    for all <code>i</code>.</li>
<li><code>result2[i0, ..., :, iR-1]</code> = <code>ifft(result1[i0, ..., :, iR-1])</code> for all <code>i</code>.</li>
<li><code>result[i0, ..., :]</code> = <code>ifft(result2[i0, ..., :])</code> for all <code>i</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, given the function <code>rfft</code> which takes 1-dimensional tensors of
floating-point types, produces 1-dimensional tensors of complex types of the
same floating-point semantics and works as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rfft(real_operand) = truncated_result</code> where</li>
<li><code>complex_operand[i] = (real_operand, 0)</code> for all <code>i</code>.</li>
<li><code>complex_result = fft(complex_operand)</code>.</li>
<li><code>truncated_result = complex_result[:(rank(complex_result) / 2 + 1)]</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>(When the discrete Fourier transform is computed for real operands, the first
<code>N/2 + 1</code> elements of the result unambiguously define the rest of the result,
so the result of <code>rfft</code> is truncated to avoid computing redundant elements).</p>
<p>For <code>fft_type = RFFT</code>, <code>result</code> is defined as the final result of a series of L
computations where <code>L = size(fft_length)</code>. For example, for <code>L = 3</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>result1[i0, ..., :]</code> = <code>rfft(operand[i0, ..., :])</code> for all <code>i</code>.</li>
<li><code>result2[i0, ..., :, iR-1]</code> = <code>fft(result1[i0, ..., :, iR-1])</code> for all <code>i</code>.</li>
<li><code>result[i0, ..., :, iR-2, iR-1]</code> = <code>fft(result2[i0, ..., :, iR-2, iR-1])</code>
    for all <code>i</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, given the function <code>irfft</code> which has the same type signature and
computes the inverse of <code>rfft</code>:</p>
<p>For <code>fft_type = IRFFT</code>, <code>result</code> is defined as the inverse of the computations
for <code>fft_type = RFFT</code>. For example, for <code>L = 3</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>result1[i0, ..., :, iR-2, iR-1]</code> = <code>ifft(operand[i0, ..., :, iR-2, iR-1])</code>
    for all <code>i</code>.</li>
<li><code>result2[i0, ..., :, iR-1]</code> = <code>ifft(result1[i0, ..., :, iR-1])</code> for all <code>i</code>.</li>
<li><code>result[i0, ..., :]</code> = <code>irfft(result2[i0, ..., :])</code> for all <code>i</code>.</li>

<p>Applies a reduction function <code>body</code> to <code>inputs</code> and <code>init_values</code> along the
<code>dimensions</code> and produces a <code>result</code> tensor.</p>
<p>The order of reductions is implementation-defined, which means that <code>body</code> and
<code>init_values</code> must form a monoid to guarantee that the operation produces the
same results for all inputs on all implementations.</p>
<p>However, this condition doesn't hold for many popular reductions. E.g.
floating-point addition for <code>body</code> and zero for <code>init_values</code> don't actually
form a monoid because floating-point addition is not associative.</p>
<p>More formally, <code>results[:][j0, ..., jR-1] = reduce(input_slices)</code> where:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>input_slices</code> = <code>inputs[:][j0, ..., :, ..., jR-1]</code>, where <code>:</code> are inserted

<li><code>reduce(input_slices)</code> = <code>exec(schedule)</code> for some binary tree <code>schedule</code>

<li><code>input_slices[:][index]</code> values, for all <code>index</code> in the index space

<p>Performs element-wise remainder of dividend <code>lhs</code> and divisor <code>rhs</code> tensors and
produces a <code>result</code> tensor.</p>
<p>More formally, the sign of the result is taken from the dividend, and the
absolute value of the result is always less than the divisor's absolute value.
The remainder is calculated as <code>lhs - d * rhs</code>, where <code>d = stablehlo.divide</code>.
For floating-point element types, this is in contrast with the <code>remainder</code>
operation from IEEE-754 specification where <code>d</code> is an integral value nearest to
the exact value of <code>lhs/rhs</code> with ties to even.</p>

<p>Produces <code>results</code> tensors which are equal to <code>inputs</code> tensors except that
several slices specified by <code>scatter_indices</code> are updated with the values
<code>updates</code> using <code>update_computation</code>.</p>
<p>The following diagram shows how elements in <code>updates[k]</code> map on elements in
<code>results[k]</code> using a concrete example. The diagram picks a few example
<code>updates[k]</code> indices and explains in detail which <code>results[k]</code> indices they
correspond to.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../images/spec/scatter.svg" /></p>
<p>More formally, for all <code>update_index</code> from the index space of <code>updates[0]</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>update_scatter_dims</code> = [<code>d</code> for <code>d</code> in <code>axes(updates[0])</code> and <code>d</code> not in
    <code>update_window_dims</code>].</li>
<li><code>update_scatter_index</code> = [<code>update_index[d]</code> for <code>d</code> in
    <code>update_scatter_dims</code>].</li>
<li><code>start_index</code> =<ul>
<li><code>scatter_indices[si0, ..., :, ..., siN]</code> where <code>si</code> are individual
    elements in <code>update_scatter_index</code> and <code>:</code> is inserted at the
    <code>index_vector_dim</code> index, if <code>index_vector_dim</code> &lt;
    <code>rank(scatter_indices)</code>.</li>
<li><code>[scatter_indices[update_scatter_index]]</code> otherwise.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For <code>do</code> in <code>axes(inputs[0])</code>,<ul>
<li><code>full_start_index[do]</code> = <code>start_index[ds]</code> if
    <code>do = scatter_dims_to_operand_dims[ds]</code>.</li>
<li><code>full_start_index[do]</code> = <code>0</code> otherwise.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>update_window_index</code> = [<code>update_index[d]</code> for <code>d</code> in <code>update_window_dims</code>].</li>
<li><code>full_window_index</code> = <code>[oi0, ..., 0, ..., oiN]</code> where <code>oi</code> are individual
    elements in <code>update_window_index</code>, and <code>0</code> is inserted at indices from
    <code>inserted_window_dims</code>.</li>
<li><code>result_index</code> = <code>add(full_start_index, full_window_index)</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given that, <code>results = exec(schedule, inputs)</code>, where:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>schedule</code> is an implementation-defined permutation of the index space
    of <code>updates[0]</code>.</li>
<li><code>exec([update_index, ...], results) = exec([...], updated_results)</code> where:<ul>
<li><code>updated_values =
  update_computation(results[:][result_index], updates[:][update_index])</code>.</li>
<li><code>updated_results</code> is a copy of <code>results</code> with <code>results[:][result_index]</code>
  set to <code>updated_values[:]</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>result_index</code> is out of bounds for <code>shape(results[:])</code>, the behavior
  is implementation-defined.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>exec([], results) = results</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If <code>indices_are_sorted</code> is <code>true</code> then the implementation can assume that
<code>scatter_indices</code> are sorted with respect to <code>scatter_dims_to_operand_dims</code>,
otherwise the behavior is undefined. More formally, for all <code>id &lt; jd</code> from
<code>indices(result)</code>, <code>full_start_index(id)</code> &lt;= <code>full_start_index(jd)</code>.</p>
<p>If <code>unique_indices</code> is <code>true</code> then the implementation can assume that all
<code>result_index</code> indices being scattered to are unique. If <code>unique_indices</code>
is <code>true</code> but the indices being scattered to are not unique then the behavior
is undefined.</p>

<p>Sends <code>inputs</code> to a channel <code>channel_id</code> and produces a <code>result</code> token.</p>
<p>The operation takes a token and produces a token to reify its side effects
as a value that other operations can take a data dependency on.</p>
<p>If <code>is_host_transfer</code> is <code>true</code>, then the operation transfers data to the
host. Otherwise, it transfers data to another device. What this means is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>More formally, given <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, <code>result[i0, ..., iR-3, :, :]</code> is the solution
to <code>op(a[i0, ..., iR-3, :, :]) * x = b[i0, ..., iR-3, :, :]</code> when <code>left_side</code> is

<ul>
<li><code>NO_TRANSPOSE</code>: Perform operation using <code>a</code> as-is.</li>
<li><code>TRANSPOSE</code>: Perform operation on transpose of <code>a</code>.</li>
<li><code>ADJOINT</code>: Perform operation on conjugate transpose of <code>a</code>.</li>

<p>Input data is read only from the lower triangle of <code>a</code>, if <code>lower</code> is <code>true</code> or
upper triangle of <code>a</code>, otherwise. Output data is returned in the same triangle;
the values in the other triangle are implementation-defined.</p>
<p>If <code>unit_diagonal</code> is true, then the implementation can assume that the diagonal
elements of <code>a</code> are equal to 1, otherwise the behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>A StableHLO program is executed by providing input values to the <code>main</code> function
and computing output values. Output values of a function are computed by
executing the graph of ops rooted in the corresponding <code>return</code> op.</p>
<p>The execution order is implementation-defined, as long as ops are executed
before their uses. Possible execution orders of the example program above are
<code>%0</code> → <code>%1</code> → <code>%2</code> → <code>%3</code> → <code>%4</code> → <code>return</code> or <code>%3</code> → <code>%0</code> → <code>%1</code> → <code>%2</code> → <code>%4</code>
→ <code>return</code>.</p>

1) a StableHLO program, 2) operation statuses (not executed yet,
already executed), and 3) intermediate values that the process is working on.
The process starts with input values to the <code>main</code> function, progresses through
the graph of ops updating operation statuses and intermediate values and
finishes with output values. Further formalization is TBD.</p>
<h3 id="parallel-execution">Parallel execution<a class="headerlink" href="#parallel-execution" title="Permanent link">link</a></h3>
<p>StableHLO programs can be executed in parallel, organized into a 2D grid of
<code>num_replicas</code> by <code>num_partitions</code> which both have type <code>ui32</code>.</p>
<p>In the <strong>StableHLO grid</strong>, <code>num_replicas * num_partitions</code> of StableHLO
processes are executing at the same time. Each process has a unique
<code>process_id = (replica_id, partition_id)</code>, where
<code>replica_id ∊ replica_ids = [0, ..., num_replicas-1]</code> and
<code>partition_id ∊ partition_ids = [0, ..., num_partitions-1]</code> which both have
type <code>ui32</code>.</p>
<p>The size of the grid is known statically for every program, and the position
within the grid is known statically for every process. Each process has access
to its position within the grid via the <code>replica_id</code> and <code>partition_id</code> ops.</p>
<p>Within the grid, the programs can all be the same (in the "Single Program,
Multiple Data" style), can all be different (in the "Multiple Program, Multiple
Data" style) or something in between.</p>
<p>Within the grid, the processes are mostly independent from each other - they
have separate operation statuses, separate input/intermediate/output values and
most of the ops are executed separately between processes, with the exception of
a small number of collective ops described below.</p>
<p>Given that execution of most of the ops is only using values from the same
process, it is usually unambiguous to refer to these values by their names.
However, when describing semantics of collective ops, that is insufficient, and
that gives rise to the notation <code>name@process_id</code> to refer to the value <code>name</code>
within a particular process. (From that perspective, unqualified <code>name</code> can be
viewed as a shorthand for <code>name@(replica_id(), partition_id())</code>).</p>
<p>The execution order across processes is implementation-defined, except for the
synchronization introduced by point-to-point communication and collective ops
as described below.</p>
<h3 id="point-to-point-communication">Point-to-point communication<a class="headerlink" href="#point-to-point-communication" title="Permanent link">link</a></h3>
<p>StableHLO processes can communicate with each other through
<strong>StableHLO channels</strong>. A channel is represented by a positive id of type
<code>si64</code>. Through various ops, it is possible to send values to channels and
receive them from channels.</p>
<p>Further formalization, e.g. where these channel ids are coming from, how
processes programs become aware of them and what kind of synchronization is
introduced by them, is TBD.</p>
<h3 id="streaming-communication">Streaming communication<a class="headerlink" href="#streaming-communication" title="Permanent link">link</a></h3>
<p>Every StableHLO process has access to two streaming interfaces:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Infeed</strong> that can be read from.</li>
<li><strong>Outfeed</strong> that can be written to.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike channels, which are used to communicate between processes and therefore
have processes at both of their ends, infeeds and outfeeds have their other
end implementation-defined.</p>
<p>Further formalization, e.g. how streaming communication influences execution
order and what kind of synchronization is introduced by it, is TBD.</p>
<h3 id="collective-ops">Collective ops<a class="headerlink" href="#collective-ops" title="Permanent link">link</a></h3>
<p>There are five collective ops in StableHLO: <code>all_gather</code>, <code>all_reduce</code>,
<code>all_to_all</code>, <code>collective_permute</code> and <code>reduce_scatter</code>. All these ops split
the processes in the StableHLO grid into <strong>StableHLO process groups</strong> and
execute a joint computation within each process group, independently from other
process groups.</p>
<p>Within each process group, collective ops may introduce a synchronization
barrier. Further formalization, e.g. elaborating on when exactly this
synchronization happens, how exactly the processes arrive at this barrier,
and what happens if they don't, is TBD.</p>
<p>If the process group involves cross-partition communication, i.e. there are
processes in the process group whose partition ids are different, then execution
of the collective op needs a channel, and the collective op must provide a
positive <code>channel_id</code> of type <code>si64</code>. Cross-replica communication doesn't need
channels.</p>
<p>The computations performed by the collective ops are specific to individual ops
and are described in individual op sections above. However, the strategies by
which the grid is split into process groups are shared between these ops and are
described in this section. More formally, StableHLO supports the following
four strategies.</p>
<h4 id="cross_replica">cross_replica<a class="headerlink" href="#cross_replica" title="Permanent link">link</a></h4>
<p>Only cross-replica communications happen within each process group. This
strategy takes <code>replica_groups</code> - a list of lists of replica ids - and computes
a Cartesian product of <code>replica_groups</code> by <code>partition_ids</code>. <code>replica_groups</code>
must have unique elements and cover all <code>replica_ids</code>. More formally:</p>

<h3 id="errors">Errors<a class="headerlink" href="#errors" title="Permanent link">link</a></h3>
<p>StableHLO programs are validated through an extensive set of constraints for
individual ops, which rules out many classes of errors prior to run time.
However, error conditions are still possible, e.g. through integer overflows,
out-of-bounds accesses, etc. Unless explicitly called out, all these errors
result in implementation-defined behavior.</p>
<p>As an exception to this rule, floating-point exceptions in StableHLO programs
have well-defined behavior. Operations which result in exceptions defined by the
IEEE-754 standard (invalid operation, division-by-zero, overflow, underflow, or
inexact exceptions) produce default results (as defined in the standard) and
continue execution without raising the corresponding status flag; similar to
<code>raiseNoFlag</code> exception handling from the standard. Exceptions for nonstandard
operations (e.g. complex arithmetic and certain transcendental functions) are
implementation-defined.</p>
